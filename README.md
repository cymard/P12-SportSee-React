# P12-SportSee-React

The purpose of this project is to create a new user profile page. For Sportsee, a young sport coaching startup.

With this page, the user will be able to follow his sessions number and burned calories number.

To get user data, this application had to communicate with this API (https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard).
